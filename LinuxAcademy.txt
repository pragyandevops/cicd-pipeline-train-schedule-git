Branches and Tags
Branches are used to maintain multiple versions of the code with different changes simultaneously.
Branches can also be used to intereact with Ci/CD pipeline.

git checkout<branch>    switching to that particular branch

git checkout -b  create a new branch and checkout simultaneously

git tag   are simply pointers to a particular commit. tag with s/w release versions is done normally

$ git branch
$ git checkout -b newBranch

git checkout master

git tag myTag
git tag
====================================

PULL REQUEST
===========================
pull requests are not actually a feature of the git software itself. however, they are a useful tool ofred
by many git remote server implementations, such as GitHub.

Usually, teams work using multiple branches to manage all their changes. At some point, these
branches need to be merged together(preferably as often as possible)

Merges can be handled locally using git, but another way to do this is through pul requests.

A pull request is a request made by a developer to merge theeir changes into another bbranch(usually a shared mainline).
It gives other team member a chance to review the changes before performing the merge.
